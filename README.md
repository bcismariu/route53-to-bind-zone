## How to Export Your Route 53 DNS Records from AWS

To use this converter, you need to export your DNS records from AWS Route 53 as a JSON file. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Open AWS CloudShell**
	- Go to the AWS Console and click the CloudShell icon in the top navigation bar.
	- Wait for the CloudShell terminal to load.

2. **List Your Hosted Zones**
	- Run:
	  ```
	  aws route53 list-hosted-zones
	  ```
	- Find the `Id` of the zone you want to export (it looks like `/hostedzone/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX`).

3. **Export DNS Records to JSON**
	- Replace `ZXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your actual hosted zone ID (omit the `/hostedzone/` prefix):
	  ```
	  aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id ZXXXXXXXXXXXXXX --output json > r53.json
	  ```
	- This creates a file named `r53.json` in your CloudShell home directory.

4. **Download the JSON File to Your Computer**
	- In CloudShell, click the **Actions** menu (top right of the terminal window) and choose **Download file**.
	- Enter `r53.json` as the file to download.
	- The file will be downloaded to your computer and is ready for use in this app.
